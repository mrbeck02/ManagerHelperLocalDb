At the beginning I thought It was to write seeders first to reset  the whole system environment, I started working on that then I chatted with Glen and he said it was for seeder referral. Then started working on seeding referral by creating new orgs(receiving/referrering) and create referral based on those orgs. But Glen didn't want to create new orgs and ask to use existing orgs. The approach had to change couple times after talking to Glen and pray
That is why you will see a lot of seeder classes got created under my ticket."
